# Question

Why do you need labels for every input? What are the two ways to associate a label with an input?

# Answer

Labels are needed for every input because they help screen reader users hear what the elements are there for, thus making the website more accessible. To associate a label with an input, we can use the attributes `aria-label=""` and `for=""`.

# Teacher Feedback

So close! We could use the for attribute and link labels and inputs in that way or we could wrap the input within the label!
