# Question

Take these 4 html buttons:

```html
<button></button>
<button type="submit"></button>
<button type="reset"></button>
<button type="button"></button>
```

What is the default behavior of each button when clicked?

# Answer

For the button with the type "submit", it submits the form. "reset" type resets the form to its initial values or blank, depending on how it was set up. Lastly, "button" type just makes a button clickable.
