# Question

Say I have a form on a page with an input for a user's email and password. When you click the submit button, suddenly the url goes from:

```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/
```

to this:

```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/?email=tom%40gmail.com&password=123456
```

The whole page refreshed as well. Why did that happen, and how can we stop it?

# Answer

It is possible that this occurred because an action and method were used. By using them, the contents (values) of the filled-out form got projected onto the query params (shows in the URL).

To stop this, we would do `event.preventDefault()`. This is used to prevent the default behaviors of a form, which is to reset and the results show up in the URL (query param) instead of showing up in the results section of the page. Through this prevention, the form would instead collect the information and display the DOM.
